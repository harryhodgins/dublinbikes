# DublinBikes Usage Analysis During COVID-19

## Project Overview
This project explores the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the usage patterns of the DublinBikes sharing system. Utilizing LASSO and Ridge Regression models, the study aims to predict changes in bike rental behavior by analyzing public datasets, including weather conditions and historical usage data.

## Data Source
The analysis is based on publicly available DublinBikes data available at https://data.gov.ie/dataset/dublinbikes-api, alongside historical weather information from Met Ã‰ireann (https://www.met.ie/climate/available-data/historical-data)

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing:** Extracted necessary features from the datasets, making use of the pandas libray for Python.
- **Modeling:** Applied LASSO and Ridge Regression to predict bike usage, incorporating cross-validation for model optimization.
- **Performance Evaluation:** Assessed model accuracy using appropriate metrics, ensuring reliable predictive insights.

## Results
The project provides valuable forecasts on bike usage, offering insights for urban mobility planning during and post-pandemic scenarios.
